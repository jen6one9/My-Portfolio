# my-portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices. 
This coding bootcamp project allowed me to create a site with responsive design which will be used to link and showcase my progression over the course of the next several months.

I created Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio using the following guidelines:
* Create the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.
* Using Bootstrap, I developed my portfolio site with the following:
   * A top navbar
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images
